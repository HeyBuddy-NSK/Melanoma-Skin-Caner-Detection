# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect melanoma a type of skin cancer, from image data. It combines image classification with a simple Flask web app to provide real-time predictions in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Image-based melanoma detection using CNN
- Flask-powered web interface for quick testing
- Preprocessing and augmentation for better accuracy
- Trained on publicly available dataset on Kaggle

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Flask
- HTML/CSS (basic UI)


## üîç How It Works

1. Upload a skin lesion image via the web UI.
2. The model processes and classifies the image.
3. Prediction result is shown: **Melanoma** or **Benign**.
